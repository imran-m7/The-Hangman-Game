Description

The Hangman Game is widely known word-guessing game that can be played alone or with a group of people. Because of its popularity during years, need for making it as a software playable application was growing bigger. In this project, a group of three students decided to make their single player version of this game on three different programming languages: C#, JavaScript and Python. Every language provides the same gameplay experience, with different interface styles and features. The idea of this project is that a player guesses one letter per move, until he/she successfully reveals the hidden word. For every incorrect guess, either with letter or a full word, one Hangman figure part is being added to that player. The game finishes when all parts of the figure have been drawn or the player guessed the hidden word correctly.

Project Goals And Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to develop a fun game, that will improve player's English vocabulary knowledge and problem-solving skills in a competitive way. Also, this project serves as a good exercise for coding and teaching how to code in three different languages. In conclusion, it improves programming and development techniques, but also it offers a wide range of English vocabulary words that can be learned.

Key Features

Random word selection- The game will use pre-set word list from where the word will be randomly selected for every new round.

Letter input check and feedback- The player will input the letter, which will be checked by the game if it was previously guessed. If it was not, game will continue checking if that letter is in the hidden word and how many times it appears. If player guessed correct, he will see the position of the guessed letter in the hidden word. On the other side, if he/she guessed wrong, one part of the hangman figure will be drawn.

Hidden word input check and feedback- If a player guesses the hidden word, the game will check if the guess is correct or not. The player will win if correct or get one figure of the hangman if wrong.

Technologies Used: C#, JavaScript and Python.

Instructions for running the project:

1. Verify you have Visual Studio Code installed
2. Download all required files from the repository for the all three languages (C#, JavaScript and Python)
3. Open the project in Visual Studio code and run it through console
